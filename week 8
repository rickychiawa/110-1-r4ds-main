This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
JohnsFamily <-
  list(
    name = "john", 
    age = 35,
    spouse = list(
      name = "Mary", 
      age = 32),
    children = list(
      list(
        name = "Bill", 
        age = 5),
      list(
        name = "Jane", 
        age = 3)
    )
  )
newborn <- list(
  list(
  name = "Lisa" ,
  age = 0
) )
JohnsFamilyCopy3 <- JohnsFamily
JohnsFamilyCopy3$children[3] <- newborn

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
